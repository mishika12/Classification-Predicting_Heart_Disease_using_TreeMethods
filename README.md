### Predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using Tree Method Machine Learning Algorithms 

 ### <ins> Problem Statement
The analysis aims to explore the various factors that help in providing information about the risk of patient developing a heart disease.

 ### <ins> Methodology
 
In addition to this analysis, the project aims to develop a predictive model that is able to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease or not using tree method algorithms like Decision trees and Random Forest. The model is then tuned further by choosing the best hyperparameters.
