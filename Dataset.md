## Heart Disease Dataset Description

The Heart Disease Dataset contains a number of variables that can be used to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. Each attribute potentially contributes information that could be used to determine heart disease risk.

### Dataset Features:

- **Age**: The patient's age in years.
- **Sex**: The patient's sex (1 = male, 0 = female).
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced (values ranging from 1 to 4).
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
- **Serum Cholestrol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results**: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2).
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during thallium stress test.
- **Exercise Induced Angina**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- **ST Depression**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **Number of Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
- **Thal**: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect).

### Target Variable:

- **Heart Disease Presence**: The presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes).
